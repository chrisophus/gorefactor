# Harness & Token-Efficiency Work — Implementation Status

Tracks the "Research-Driven Harness and Token Efficiency" plan (2026-07-01).
Each phase names the specific cost it removes and confirms that cost is
present before optimizing (the plan's design rule).

## What shipped (code, in this repo)

### Phase 1 — Tool-output masking (`cmd/gorefactor-agent/history_mask.go`)

Cost removed: input-token accumulation from stale tool outputs re-sent every
round. Confirmed present: the agentic loop carried full tool history forward.

`maskStaleToolOutputs(msgs, maskAfterRounds)` replaces the body of every
tool result older than the last `maskAfterRounds` (=3) assistant turns with a
one-line structured stub (`[elided: lint_path result, 1423 bytes; …]`).
Recency is the **sole** trigger. Structure is preserved (message count and
ordering unchanged) so the provider invariant "a tool message follows its
tool_call" holds. Applied at prompt-assembly time only — the raw transcript
and the Phase 6 corpus are untouched. Wired into both `RunAgenticDriver` and
`RunInteractiveAgenticDriver`, composed with the existing `compactMessages`
window.

Never masked (by construction of the recency cutoff): the system prompt, the
task objective (a user message), and the most-recent error (always inside the
keep window). `N=3` is the starting value; tune against the Phase 0 baseline.

Composition with `compactMessages`: masking and compaction are order-independent
— both key off distance from the end of the message list (compaction trims
only the front; masking counts assistant turns from the back), so masking
always ends up operating on whatever tail compaction keeps, every round, for
the life of a long conversation. `assembleHistory` centralizes this
composition in one place; see `TestAssembleHistoryOrderIndependent` for the
empirical check that ordering doesn't change the result (verified — an earlier
draft of this doc claimed masking's benefit was confined to a narrow window
before compaction kicked in, which was wrong).

Not wired into `RunDriver` (single-shot mode): it keeps no growing message
history (`feedback` is a single string overwritten each iteration, not an
accumulating transcript), so there is nothing to mask there.

### Phase 2 — Runtime token budget with stop-and-summarize

Cost removed: spend past the accuracy plateau. Confirmed present: usage was
tracked but nothing enforced a ceiling.

`-budget N` flag (0 = unlimited) on `gorefactor-agent`. Before each model
round the loop checks cumulative prompt+completion tokens; on exhaustion it
emits a **structured punt** (`autopunt:budget_exhausted`) rather than killing
mid-edit — the journal/undo system makes this safe. `RunCampaign` enforces the
same value as an aggregate cap across findings and stops cleanly instead of
churning every remaining finding into a punt. Budget hits are logged to the
Phase 6 corpus. Wired into all three drivers, including single-shot
`RunDriver` — `emitRunMetrics`/`tokensUsed` take `any` rather than
`toolChatter` specifically so a plain `Provider` (which also implements
`tokenStater`) works the same way.

Default is unlimited: the plan's computed default (smallest budget `b` where
`success_rate(b) ≥ 0.95·success_rate(unbudgeted)`) requires the Phase 0
dataset and is **deferred** to that measurement.

### Phase 3 — Blast-radius instrumentation (`cmd/gorefactor-agent/instrument.go`)

Cost removed: misrouted tasks. Confirmed present: routing is judgment-based.

`specBlastRadius` extracts the primary target symbol from the spec and runs
`gorefactor blast-radius --json`, emitting the composite score in every
`RUN_METRICS` block next to actual tokens spent and outcome. This is **pure
instrumentation** — routing is *not* wired, because the plan gates that on a
measured correlation beating the 0.39 self-prediction bar, which needs the
Phase 0 dataset. The data needed to compute that correlation is now logged
(including from `RunDriver`, so single-shot runs contribute too).

`primarySymbol` skips a stopword list of common leading refactor verbs
(rename, move, extract, delete, …) and prefers a match that looks like a real
Go identifier (CamelCase or `Receiver:Method`) over a plain title-case English
word — a naturally-phrased spec ("Rename Foo to Bar") capitalizes its first
word as ordinary sentence case, and without this filter the extractor
resolved to the leading verb instead of the actual target on every such spec.

### Phase 4 — Persistent cross-session notes (`cmd/gorefactor-agent/notes.go`)

Cost removed: re-discovery tokens at session start. Confirmed present: warm
punt state died with the process.

`.gorefactor/notes.md` is loaded into the system prompt at agent start and
appended only via the dedicated `note` tool (categories: `repo_fact`,
`failed_strategy`, `flaky_test`, `open_punt`) — never a free-form file write,
preserving the harness principle. Punts also auto-record an `open_punt` note so
the next session does not re-attempt known-infeasible work. When notes.md
crosses `notesCompactionThreshold` (=200 lines) `appendNote` emits an advisory
that a crucible purify pass is due.

The crucible purify compaction itself is **deferred**: it requires the crucible
`purify` binary, which is not present in this repo.

`RunDriver` (single-shot mode) loads notes into its system prompt too, but
read-only — single-shot has no tool-calling surface for the model to call
`note` itself. Its budget-exhaustion punt still goes through `doPunt`, so an
`open_punt` note is recorded there the same as in the agentic drivers.

### Phase 6 — Failure corpus (`cmd/gorefactor-agent/corpus.go`)

Cost removed: repeated mistakes. Confirmed present: rejections happened and
nothing accumulated them.

Every rejected mutation op (`recordRejectedOp`), every budget hit, and every
punt is appended to `.gorefactor/failures.jsonl` — a passive sensor that never
gates a run. `.gorefactor/` is gitignored, so the corpus survives the agent's
`git clean -fd` rollback across attempts (its whole point). `RunDriver`
(single-shot mode) logs its own rejection points too — validator rejection,
apply failure, and gate failure — under the same `failRejectedOp` kind. The
manual classification pass (every 25 entries → lint rule / prompt amendment /
new capability) and the crucible-purify check on prompt amendments are process
steps, not code.

## Deferred (require external infrastructure, not code in this repo)

- **Phase 0 — benchmark re-baseline.** Needs live frontier + local model runs
  (≥5 per scenario) with API keys. Every measurement-based exit criterion below
  depends on it.
- **Phase 5 — crucible purification at the two spec chokepoints.** Needs the
  crucible `purify` pipeline binary. Integration points identified: campaign
  objective (`campaign.go`, before loop entry) and senior→junior handoff
  (`campaign_run.go`). 5b is explicitly droppable on its own break-even
  inequality once Phase 0/2 data exists.
- **All A/B measurements and correlation computations** in Phases 1–5. The code
  emits the signals (masked-history token counts, `blast_radius` in RUN_METRICS,
  budget events); computing the deltas is the deferred experiment.

## Exit criteria still open (measurement)

1. Cumulative frontier prompt tokens per scenario ↓ ≥50% vs Phase 0 (Phase 1).
2. Cross-run token variance compressed toward single digits (Phases 2, 5a).
3. A routing signal with correlation > 0.39 to spend, or a documented negative
   result (Phase 3).
4. First-three-rounds token cost lower on repos with mature notes (Phase 4).
5. Zero recurrence of classified failure patterns post-fix (Phase 6).
